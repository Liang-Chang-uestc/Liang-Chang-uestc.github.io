## Research Overview

<div>
  <span>
      Liang Chang was working toward advanced memory-centric computer architecture and IC chips, such as nonvolatile memory (MRAM and RRAM), artificial 
    intelligent processor, general computing processing unit.  He has successful tape-out more than ten chips on ASIC, CPU, AI processors and NVM chips. 
    Both emerging nonvolatile memory and computing-in memory architecture will promote the memory-centric processor. But, in the first step, we should have
    high quality and safety memory, and energy-efficient computing unit, separetly. We can research from device-circuit-architecture-application cross-layer 
    to reach our goal.
